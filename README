============================================= Ideas and roadmaps for Pioneer =============================================

MISSIONS:
* mass transit overflow missions to nearby stars <10ly
    mass transit failed for some reason and X passengers need transit
    make "logical jump destinations" more likely to have "extra" missions
    if the player is going anyways, go with them

* large cargo missions (~100t?)

* both passenger + cargo at once missions

* rotate worker crew, transport # crew there and # crew back for shoreleave
    rotate crew to barnards star, obtain permit

* gambling missions
    future date set for "the draw"
    legal/illegal depending on faction or economy

* sample atmosphere
    requires fuelscoop in lua

* non-player entries for organisations to communicate with their agents
    nonsensical crypto-speak stories to convey secret messages, like
    "Little Red Riding Hood and her daughter escaped last months encounter with Beaver Bob.
    Big Bad Wolf dispatched and should arrive shortly. Prepare hot porridge and make the beds.
    Old Man and the Fish still awaiting approval."

GAME ENGINE:

* One time use hyperdrive
    limited range 10ly?
    change device from "unused" to "burnt out" after use
    small mass (1t)

(IN PROGRESS) * push fuel scooping as an event in lua instead of just adding hydrogen to cargo in C++
    making fuel scooping into a lua event makes possible missions to sample atmospheres

* push lack of cargo life support as lua event instead of handling it in C++

* MAJOR: change mass attributes to kg instead of tonnes
    load cargo by volume, but still enforce mass limits

* rework engines to base everything on ISP instead of the current mishmash
    make ISP a difficulty setting
    Monatomic Hydrogen Ion Drive: ISP = 200 000 - 15 000 000.
    ideal photonic 30,000,000
    make thrusters replacable, make default thrusters start at 80-90% efficiency

(IN PROGRESS) * make lua SpaceStation:Constructor() call "setDefaultStationProperties()"
    check each unique station for a custom settings json file
    set unique station identifier as "station charter license nr#"
    allow license to be visually overriden, like "Unlicensed"
    read Lore text from the same json file

* during galaxy creation, add "population pressure" so that stars
  within sublight range of earth are much more likely to be colonized & populated
    (colonizing age start - now) / 10 (10 years per lightyear at 10% of c) = sublight max range
    population growth calculated from colonists on ship (~100-200k) times 1.2-1.8/20years of arrival
    news stories about colony ships arriving at ~sublightmaxrange

* add a "Musk" station to Mars

* allow equipment to be repackaged into cargo for transport

* make planets where rubbish is an import with a positive price
    + radioactives
    planet with enormous energy surplus, not orbital stations
* solar power station on/around sol-mercury
    set rubbish to positive trade value
    mercury is energy abundant, perfect for recycling

* OUTSIDE MY CAPABILITIES: strip out "create new game" code and make new games be loading a savegame
    gets rid of redundant code: if you can load a game you can "start a new game"

(DONE) * game settings by double-clicking pause-button

* make star systems in logbook clickable to set as destination

* unlisted stations
    covert, crime, pirates, naval...

* "traderoutes" highlighted in sectorview like for the core systems in Elite II
    missions more often available for these traderoute systems

* clear button for search dialogues

* new building: solar thermal plant

* hire storage bays to store ships and cargo

* upgrade/mods tied to specific ship types

* computer viruses
    - annoying, plastering ads on flight hud
    - money drainer
    - slow down hyperdrive charging
    crews assigned to computer might detect viruses

* unloading and unloading cargo takes in-game time
    different ships have different ease of loading

* use decal system to create advertising billboards

* integrated passenger cabins for passenger ships

* (IN PROGRESS) shields charging and capacity determined by equipment attributes, not hardcoded

* make possible to redirect lua debug output to a dedicated file instead of output.txt
    so scripts can have their own output file instead of digging through output.txt

* graphical jump activation panel:

            ,----------JUMP----------.
            |      Energy Charge     |
            [=======>                ]
            | Trajectory Calculation |
            [===========>            ]
            `-------[Activate]-------'

        energy charge would reach green levels in ~5-10 seconds
        calculation would reach green levels in about the same,
        but the longer you let it calculate, the more accurate
        the jump will become, but each increase in precision will
        take exponentially longer.
        - energy charge time could depend on
            crew skills, hyperdrive (drv charging equipment?)
            type of fuel used for charging
            radioactive cargo could cause glitches
        - trajectory calculation could depend on
            ship computer, crew kills, having "detailed system charts",
            being near a gravity well, being in atmosphere

* different levels of cargo hold conversions
    life support for livestock/slaves/refugees
    hazmat A for toxic/corrosives
    hazmat B for explosives/radioactives
    hazmat C for biological agents
    hazmat ABC...

* new commodities:
    nitrogen, ammonia
