============================================= Ideas and roadmaps for Pioneer =============================================

* One time use hyperdrive
    limited range 10ly?
    change device from "unused" to "burnt out" after use
    small mass (1t)

* mass transit overflow missions to nearby stars <10ly
    mass transit failed for some reason and X passengers need transit
    make "logical jump destinations" more likely to have "extra" missions
    if the player is going anyways, go with them

* large cargo missions (~100t?)

* both passenger + cargo at once missions

* push fuel scooping as an event in lua instead of just adding hydrogen to cargo in C++

* push lack of cargo life support as lua event instead of handling it in C++

* MAJOR: change mass attributes to kg instead of tonnes

* rework engines to base everything on ISP instead of the current mishmash
    make ISP a difficulty setting
    Monatomic Hydrogen Ion Drive: ISP = 200 000 - 15 000 000.
    ideal photonic 30,000,000
    make thrusters replacable, make default thrusters start at 80-90% efficiency

* make lua SpaceStation:Constructor() call "setDefaultStationProperties()"
    check each unique station for a custom settings json file
    set unique station identifier as "station charter license nr#"
    allow license to be visually overriden, like "Unlicensed"
    read Lore text from the same json file

* during galaxy creation, add "population pressure" so that stars
  within sublight range of earth are much more likely to be colonized & populated
    (colonizing age start - now) / 10 (10 years per lightyear at 10% of c) = sublight max range
    population growth calculated from colonists on ship (~100-200k) times 1.2-1.8/20years of arrival
    news stories about colony ships arriving at ~sublightmaxrange

* add a "Musk" station to Mars

* allow equipment to be repackaged into cargo for transport

* make planets where rubbish is an import with a positive price
    + radioactives
    planet with enormous energy surplus, not orbital stations

* OUTSIDE MY CAPABILITIES: strip out "create new game" code and make new games be loading a savegame
    gets rid of redundant code: if you can load a game you can "start a new game"

* game settings by double-clicking pause-button

* make star systems in logbook clickable to set as destination

* new mission: rotate worker crew, transport # crew there and # crew back for shoreleave
    rotate crew to barnards star, obtain permit

* unlisted stations
    covert, crime, pirates, naval...

* "traderoutes" highlighted in sectorview like for the core systems in Elite II
    missions more often available for these traderoute systems

* gambling missions
    future date set for "the draw"
    legal/illegal depending on faction or economy

* clear button for search dialogues

* new building: solar thermal plant

* hire storage bays to store ships and cargo

* upgrade/mods tied to specific ship types

* computer viruses
    - annoying, plastering ads on flight hud
    - money drainer
    - slow down hyperdrive charging
    crews assigned to computer might detect viruses

* unloading and unloading cargo takes in-game time
    different ships have different ease of loading
